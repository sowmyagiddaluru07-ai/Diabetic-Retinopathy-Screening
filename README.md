# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Screening
This project implements an automated Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening system using deep learning techniques. It aims to assist in early detection of DR by classifying retinal fundus images into different severity levels. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps.
